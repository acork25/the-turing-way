# Barriers to reproducibility

So far we have described the [importance](../01/importantforscience) of reproducible research and motivated why we think [you should care](../02/whycare).

But there are many barriers to reproducible research.
You can watch Kirstie Whitaker describe some of them in [her talk about The Turing Way](https://youtu.be/wZeoZaIV0VE?t=312) at [csv,conf,v4](https://csvconf.com/2019) in May 2019.
The section describing the slide below starts around 5 minutes into the video.

## Requires additional skills

In order to produce reproducable research, the researcher is required to possess organisational skills which allows them to track and document the changes and decisions that are made throughout their project. This may involve using new softwares and tools in order to optimise the transparency of their decisions. However, creating reproducable research may not actually require many additional skills despite the perceieved barrier.
